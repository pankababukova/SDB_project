title: Organization of evacuation actions in the municipality of Leibnitz, Styria, based on exposure analysis to flood hazard
description: We are developing an application which optimizes the organization of evacuation actions in the case of a major flood event in Styria. The two main results from the project are: (1) an exposure analysis of the population and key assets, and (2) finding safe and optimal evacuation routes.
Potential users are both rescue services and citizens in Styria. The exposure analysis enables localization of assets in flood risk areas. Rescue operators can thus plan allocation of forces in the case of an emergency. On the other hand, the analysis can improve individual preparedness for disasters, by raising awareness about the presence of the natural hazard. The second result, finding optimal evacuation routes, can also be used by both target groups. Rescue services can find optimal routes from gathering points to evacuation centers. At the same time, the part of the population which is capable of organizing an individual evacuation can select the optimal and safe route to the evacuation sites.
